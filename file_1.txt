A new line so I can see diffs
This is a git class
On Friday morning
We have way too much snow outside
my husband is disappointed we didn't get as much snow as was expected, we're not originally from Michigan, lol
thanks for coming to class!
I hope you enjoy the rest of your Friday, and have a great weekend! :-)
